1. Color Palette (Refined & Systematized)
Your initial palette is strong. Let's assign them specific roles to prevent inconsistency.

Primary Colors:

Navy Blue (#1A2B4C) - Primary Brand Color

Use for: Primary buttons, main app bar, active tab indicators, key headlines.

Emerald Green (#2E8B57) - Positive & Success Color

Use for: "Export" transactions, profit numbers, success states, confirmations.

Neutral Colors:

Slate Gray (#708090) - Secondary Neutral

Use for: Secondary text, disabled states, borders, icons.

Charcoal (#333333) - Primary Text & Surface

Use for: Primary body text, headings on light backgrounds.

Off-White (#F5F5F5) - Background & Canvas

Use for: Main app background, card backgrounds.

Semantic Colors (Accents with Purpose):

Crimson Red (#DC143C) - Negative & Danger Color

Use for: "Import" transactions, errors, warning alerts, debt numbers.

Gold (#FFD700) - Warning & Highlight Color

Use for: High-priority warnings, "Premium" tags, critical thresholds.

Teal (#008080) - Informational & Interactive Color

Use for: Informational links, neutral interactive elements, secondary CTA buttons.

2. Typography
We'll use a clear hierarchy based on font weight and size rather than multiple font families for simplicity and performance.

Font Family: Roboto (The standard, highly readable Flutter font) or Inter (A modern, geometric sans-serif available via Google Fonts). Both are excellent for UI.

Styles:

Headline (Roboto/Inter Bold - 24pt)

TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Charcoal)

Use for: Page titles (e.g., "Treasury Overview").

Subtitle (Roboto/Inter SemiBold - 18pt)

TextStyle(fontSize: 18, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600, color: Charcoal)

Use for: Card titles, section headers.

Body (Roboto/Inter Regular - 16pt)

TextStyle(fontSize: 16, fontWeight: FontWeight.normal, color: Charcoal)

Use for: Most of your text, transaction descriptions.

Caption (Roboto/Inter Regular - 14pt)

TextStyle(fontSize: 14, fontWeight: FontWeight.normal, color: Slate Gray)

Use for: Dates, metadata, secondary information.

3. Components Style
This is where the "feel" of the app comes together. Based on your color choices (which lean professional and stable), I recommend the following:

Corners: Rounded

Decision: Rounded corners.

Why? Rounded corners (e.g., borderRadius: 12.0) feel more modern, approachable, and safer. They guide the eye smoothly and are less "sharp" and intimidating, which is good for financial data.

Style: Flat Design with Subtle Depth

Decision: Flat Design, enhanced with very subtle shadows for hierarchy.

Why? A purely flat design can lack hierarchy. A neumorphic design can be visually noisy for data-heavy apps. The best middle ground is a clean, flat design that uses subtle shadows to distinguish interactive elements from the background.

Implementation:

Cards: BoxShadow(color: Colors.black12, blurRadius: 4.0, offset: Offset(0, 2))

Buttons (Primary): No shadow, just a solid Navy Blue fill.

Buttons (Floating Action): A slightly stronger shadow to make it feel "lifted".

Shadows: Yes, Subtly

As mentioned above, use shadows sparingly to create a clear z-axis hierarchy. Background has no shadow, cards have a slight shadow, and a FAB has a more pronounced shadow.

Putting It All Together: Example Components
Hereâ€™s how these rules would manifest in your app:

App Bar:

Background: Navy Blue (#1A2B4C)

Text: White, using Headline style.

Transaction List Item:

Card: White background, rounded corners (12.0), subtle shadow.

Title (Subtitle): Charcoal.

Amount:

If Export: Emerald Green, SemiBold.

If Import: Crimson Red, SemiBold.

Date (Caption): Slate Gray.

Primary Button:

Corners: Rounded (8.0).

Summary Card on Dashboard:

Background: White, rounded corners (16.0), subtle shadow.

"Total Balance" (Subtitle): Charcoal.

Balance Figure (Headline): Navy Blue.

"This Month" (Body): Slate Gray.
